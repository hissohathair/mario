# Super 50 Mario

Super 50 Mario assignment 4 from CS50G

Original code [by Colton Ogden](https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/projects/4/mario/)

Assignment:

1. ~~When the player is dropped into the level, ensure theyâ€™re always above solid ground.~~
2. ~~Generate a random-colored key and lock block. The key should unlock the block when the player collides with it, triggering the block to disappear.~~
3. ~~Once the lock has disappeared, trigger a goal post to spawn at the end of the level.~~
4. ~~When the player touches this goal post, regenerate the level, and restart. The new level should be a little longer than before.~~


# Playing

Keys:

* *space*: Jump
* *left*, *right*, *up*, *down* arrows: Move player
* *escape*: Quit game
* *m*: Toggle Music on or off
* *x*: (Debug mode only) Reset the level
* *s*: (Debug mode only) Take a screenshot. Location of file is printed to the console

# Game Notes

## Known Bugs

* ~~There's a bug that causes the game to crash when the player jumps *onto* a flagpole instead of walking up to it~~ (Fixed)
* Collision detection is slightly off still -- player has trouble falling or jumping through gaps that *should* be just wide enough
* Level generation occassionally creates uncompleteable levels, because a pillar makes a lock box inaccessible for example

## Notes and "todo" items

* Debug mode is turned on by setting `DEBUG_MODE` to `true` in [main.lua](main.lua)
* Would like for the camera to pan over to where the flagpole goal is spawning so the player knows what it means to "unlock" a locked box
