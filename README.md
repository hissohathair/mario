# Super 50 Mario

Super 50 Mario assignment 4 from CS50G

Original code [by Colton Ogden](https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/projects/4/mario/)

Assignment:

1. When the player is dropped into the level, ensure theyâ€™re always above solid ground.
2. Generate a random-colored key and lock block. The key should unlock the block when the player collides with it, triggering the block to disappear.
3. Once the lock has disappeared, trigger a goal post to spawn at the end of the level.
4. When the player touches this goal post, regenerate the level, and restart. The new level should be a little longer than before. 


# Playing
